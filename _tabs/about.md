I'm a Hamburg-based Software Engineer, specializing in anything DevOps (whatever that means exactly).

I'm looking to enable other developers to pursue their own passion projects more efficiently
by spreading knowledge about deploying and scaling your software through local community engagement,
conference talks and this blog.

Privately, I enjoy lifting weights, going hiking, biking, running or swimming. We all spend enough times in front
of screens as it is. I also make music, 
[occasionally produce a song or two](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2M3v41tQLJG1nek13NGrow?si=DWXwEepQRJyifdVJ2zB_QA), 
and play chess.

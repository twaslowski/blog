I'm a Hamburg-based Software Engineer, currently working as a Consultant at Thoughtworks.

On the job, I primarily do infrastructure work these days, creating scalable cloud-native applications in AWS.

On my personal projects, I love working with Python, and discovering how to make Python as clean as possible.
Using `mypy` and `pytest` as well as a _lot_, I've created clean and scalable Python applications. 
Check out [this project](https://github.com/twaslowski/lingolift) for examples.

Privately, I enjoy lifting weights, going hiking, biking, running or swimming. We all spend enough times in front
of screens as it is. I also make music, 
[occasionally produce a song or two](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2M3v41tQLJG1nek13NGrow?si=DWXwEepQRJyifdVJ2zB_QA), 
and play chess.

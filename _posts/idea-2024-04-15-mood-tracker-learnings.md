key takeaways:

1. coding is not just about the product, but also about the process.
applying a certain degree of patterns and practices makes your code more fun to work with. 
when you have a certain degree of tests and code quality, it is much more enjoyable to work on the project.
2. treat your project like an actual product at work. best practices are best practices for a reason.
3. moving to the cloud partially is an option (raspberry pi for compute, Cloudwatch for logs, DynamoDB for storage)
